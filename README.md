#### Abstract

Though many attempts have been made in blind super-resolution to restore low-resolution images with unknown and complex degradations, they are still far from addressing general real-world degraded images. In this work, we extend the powerful ESRGAN to a practical restoration application (namely, Real-ESRGAN), which is trained with pure synthetic data. Specifically, a high-order degradation modeling process is introduced to better simulate complex real-world degradations. We also consider the common ringing and overshoot artifacts in the synthesis process. In addition, we employ a U-Net discriminator with spectral normalization to increase discriminator capability and stabilize the training dynamics. Extensive comparisons have shown its superior visual performance than prior works on various real datasets. We also provide efficient implementations to synthesize training pairs on the fly.

We are cleaning the training codes. It will be finished on 23 or 24, July.

You can download **Windows executable files** from https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN/releases/download/v0.1.0/RealESRGAN-ncnn-vulkan.zip

You can simply run the following command:
```bash
./realesrgan-ncnn-vulkan.exe -i input.jpg -o output.png
```

Note that it may introduce block artifacts (and also generate slightly different results from the PyTorch implementation), because this executable file first crops the input image into several tiles, and then processes them separately, finally stitches together.

This executable file is based on the wonderful [ncnn project](https://github.com/Tencent/ncnn) and [realsr-ncnn-vulkan](https://github.com/nihui/realsr-ncnn-vulkan).
